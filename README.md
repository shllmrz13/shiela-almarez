# Project Setup

Follow these steps to run the project and continuously watch for CSS changes:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all necessary project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. In a separate terminal, start the TailwindCSS watcher to rebuild the CSS on each file change:
   ```bash
   npm run twatch
   ```

With these steps, the project will run, and CSS changes will be applied automatically.
